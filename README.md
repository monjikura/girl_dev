Abstract - The Second Polish Republic,[e] at the time officially known as the Republic of Poland,[f] was a country in Central and Eastern Europe that existed between 7 October 1918 and 6 October 1939.

The Polish government-in-exile was established in Paris and later London after the fall of France in 1940
